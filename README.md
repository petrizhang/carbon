# Coco
A purely functional and strongly typed programming language running on JVM.

## Development Status

The goal of this project is to implement Haskell's core features (in particular, the type system)  on JVM with Scala.

Up to now, I have implemented a type inferencer for the [Hindleyâ€“Milner (HM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) type system (located at [typer](https://github.com/pzque/carbon/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/pzque/coco/typer)), which is the basis of Haskell's typing.

The complete type system outlined in [Typing in Haskell](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/thih/thih.pdf) is still under development in the mid-stage (located at [typer2](https://github.com/pzque/carbon/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/pzque/coco/typer2)).

I will resume the development when I have enough time.
